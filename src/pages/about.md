## A Brief Introduction

Hello! I'm Ted. I've been a musician for most of my life. I've been in a lot of bands, and while you've almost certainly
never heard of any of the bands I was in, I also wouldn't necessarily consider them to be completely inconsequential
either. This is a state in which a lot of people who went to L.A. and had a certain degree of success end up. It's a
state of having been almost almost famous. I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end ... ahem. Anyway, it's
_fiiiiiiine_. I'm fine. Totally fine.

This site emerged largely as a way for me to encourage and document a daily creative practice for myself. A lot of
people have a daily writing practice, or a daily drawing practice. I have a daily music practice. It's usually just me
improvising increasingly sad music on an acoustic guitar, but hey, it's something.

Here is some code:

```css
.full-bleed {
  width: 100vw;
  margin-left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```

And some lines under it.
