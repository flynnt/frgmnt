Well, it happened again. The automated job I have that deploys this site for the sole purpose of updating my Last.FM feed has been canceled because I haven't posted in a while. That's fine. It just means that I'll just have to say things more or less off the top of my head, which to be honest makes this seem closer to an actual journal than anything else. I mean, have you ever read the actual journal of an osentsibly interesting person from a period in time where journaling was, in fact, more like brief and personal record keeping? Boring as fuck.

I follow a bot on Mastodon that posts Samuel Pepys' journal entries. Here's one:

>Mr. Spong came to me, and so he and I sat singing upon the leads till almost ten at night and so he went away (a pretty, harmless, and ingenious man), and I to bed, in a very great content of mind, which I hope by my care still in my business will continue to me.

If you've ever spent any time with historical records or letters or whatever, once you get past the novelty of reading cursive on microfiche you realize that there's definitely a wide spectrum of what counts as journaling ranging from painstaking accounts of how many pieces of grain someone's neighbor owes them to like, I dunno, Oscar Wilde.

But even Oscar Wilde, at some point, still had to write mundane letters and journal entries. I have an entire book of them.

This is why historians fascinate me. I have never met a group of people so able to withstand absolute volumes of banality more than historians. It is an academic superpower.

Alright, post accomplished.
